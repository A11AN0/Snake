Pseudocode Steps

1. Since it's probably going to be referenced alot, set a constant name for the arena
2. A function that will draw the head of the snake on the arena and take x and y coordinates as parameters
3. A function that will log the arrow keys pressed
4. A function that, once provided the pressed arrow key, will change the value of the afforementioned x and y coordinates
5. A function that will draw the snake head in the new position (given the new x/y coordinates)
6. A function that will keep drawing the snake head moving in one direction until another arrow key is pressed, while not allowing it to reverse
7. A function that will make x number of sections to follow the snake head while it moves
9. A function to make the snake grow x amount of segments when it touches the food
8. A function that will draw food on a random x/y coordinate
10. A function to relocate the food to another random location (which is not in contact with any part of the snake)
11. A function which causes the game to end if the snake touches its body/the edge of the arena
